## 1. Introduction
Welcome to the deployment documentation for [Your Application Name]. This document provides step-by-step instructions on how to set up your development environment, run tests, and deploy the application to both the staging and production environments.

## 2. Prerequisites
Before proceeding with deployment, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

- [List of Prerequisites, e.g., Node.js, npm, Docker, Kubernetes, Database, etc.]

## 3. Setting Up the Development Environment
To work on the application locally, follow these steps to set up your development environment:

### 3.1. Clone the Repository
```shell
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>
```

### 3.2. Install Dependencies
```shell
npm install
```

### 3.3. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root and configure the necessary environment variables. Refer to the sample `.env.example` file for guidance.

### 3.4. Start the Development Server
```shell
npm start
```

Your development environment is now set up, and you can access the application locally at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## 4. Running Tests
Ensure the application functions correctly by running tests. Execute the following command:

```shell
npm test
```

This command will run unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests depending on your project's testing strategy.

## 5. Deployment to Staging Environment
Before deploying to the production environment, it's advisable to test changes in a staging environment. Follow these steps to deploy to the staging environment:

### 5.1. Build the Application
```shell
npm run build
```

### 5.2. Deploy to Staging
[Include instructions for your staging environment, e.g., deploying to a staging server, using a staging database.]

## 6. Deployment to Production Environment
Once you've tested in the staging environment and are satisfied with the results, follow these steps to deploy to the production environment:

### 6.1. Build the Application
```shell
npm run build
```

### 6.2. Deploy to Production
[Include instructions for your production environment, e.g., deploying to a production server, configuring production database settings.]

## 7. Maintenance and Troubleshooting
This section should include information on how to handle common maintenance tasks and troubleshoot deployment issues. Include contact information for support or development teams, if applicable.
